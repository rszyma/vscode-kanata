A VS Code extension that adds language support for [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) configuration files.

This extension aims to stay up-to-date with latest kanata git.
Whenever something changes in `parser` folder in kanata repository, at the end of the day,
Github Actions will automatically build a new version of this extension with updated parser.

## Features

Kanata config files are detected by `.kbd` file extension.

### Syntax highlighting

keywords, action identifiers, alias handles etc.

### Checking for config errors

Config will be parsed and validated, when saving document.

### Support for including other files

If you use [`include`](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/config.adoc#include-other-files)
configuration items in your kanata config, make sure to adjust the following settings:
- `vscode-kanata.includesAndWorkspaces`
- `vscode-kanata.mainConfigFile`

Important: Absolute paths in `include` blocks that point outside the opened workspace aren't supported.

Also, if you work with multiple main files, and find yourself switching `mainConfigFile` often,
there's a handy command palette entry:
- `Kanata: Set current file as main`

### Formatter: auto-apply spacial layout of `defsrc` to all `deflayer`s

This is enabled by default, because I've seen a lot of kanata configs, and it seems like
majority of users prefer to align their `deflayer`s according to spacial layout of `defsrc`.
If you have "Auto format on save enabled" and don't want this feature, you can disable
it in settings (search for "kanata.format").
